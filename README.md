# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of three machine learning paradigms (supervised and unsupervised learning are the other two areas). In RL we are concerned with how "agents" or robots take actions within the environment.  

There are two RL exercises here:

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The purpose of the exercise is to create a model that learns how to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two versions of the game, the first, is a 3-x-3 matrix and the second is a 4-x-4 matrix. Original code is credited to Ryan Rudes (2020).

## Robot Factory Navigation 

The purpose of this assignment is to train a robot to navigate an environment (a guitar building factory) such that the robot moves through the factory in the most efficient manner to collect the required parts for building the guitar. To achieve this goal requires that the robot learn the factory layout (environment), the rooms or locations within the environment (states, n = 9) and how to navigate them (actions).  

The code for this exercise is in a 3 x 3 space is: https://github.com/melissaEYE/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Q8%20Q-Learning%20using%20numpy.ipynb 

The code for this exercise is in a 4 x 4 space is: https://github.com/melissaEYE/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Q9%20Q-Learning%20using%20numpy.ipynb
